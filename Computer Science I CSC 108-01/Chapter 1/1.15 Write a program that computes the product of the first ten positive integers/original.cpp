/*
Write a program that computes the product of the first ten positive integers, 1 × 2 × … × 10, and the sum of the reciprocal of each number. (1/1,1/2,1/3,…) (Use the * symbol, not × for multiplication in C++).

ask the user to enter 10 numbers.

Try writing the program, and check the results against a pocket calculator. The program’s results aren’t likely to be correct.

Then write the numbers as reciprocals of the input numbers, 1/x1, 1/x2, . . ., 1/xn, and run the program again.
