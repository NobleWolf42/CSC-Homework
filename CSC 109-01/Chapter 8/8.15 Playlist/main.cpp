Assignment:
You will be building a linked list. Make sure to keep track of both the head and tail nodes.

Step 1: Create three files to submit and build the PlaylistNode class.

    - PlaylistNode.h - Class declaration
    - PlaylistNode.cpp - Class definition
    - main.cpp - main() function

Build the PlaylistNode class per the following specifications. Note: Some functions can initially be function stubs (empty functions), to be completed in later steps.

    - Private data members
        - string uniqueID - Initialized to "none" in default constructor
        - string songName - Initialized to "none" in default constructor
        - string artistName - Initialized to "none" in default constructor
        - int songLength - Initialized to 0 in default constructor
        - PlaylistNode* nextNodePtr - Initialized to 0 in default constructor
    - Default constructor (1 pt)
    - Parameterized constructor (1 pt)
    - Public member functions
        - GetID() - Accessor
        - GetSongName() - Accessor
        - GetArtistName() - Accessor
        - GetSongLength() - Accessor
        - GetNext() - Accessor
        - InsertAfter(PlaylistNode* nodePtr) - Mutator (1 pt)
        - SetNext(PlaylistNode* nodePtr) - Mutator (1 pt)
        - PrintPlaylistNode() - Outputs uniqueID, songname, artistName, and songLength based on the format example below.

Ex. of PrintPlaylistNode output:

    *Unique ID: S123
    *Song Name: Peg
    *Artist Name: Steely Dan
    *Song Length (in seconds): 237

Step 2: In main(), prompt the user for the title of the playlist. (1 pt)

Ex:

    *Enter playlist's title:
    *JAMZ 

Step 3: Implement the PrintMenu() function. (1 pt)

PrintMenu() takes the playlist title as a parameter and outputs a menu of options to manipulate the playlist.

Ex:

    *JAMZ PLAYLIST MENU
    *a - Add song
    *d - Remove song
    *c - Change position of song
    *s - Output songs by specific artist
    *t - Output total time of playlist (in seconds)
    *o - Output full playlist
    *q - Quit

Step 4: Implement the ExecuteMenu() function. (1 pt)

ExecuteMenu() takes 3 parameters: a character representing the user's choice, a playlist title, and the pointer to the head node of a playlist. ExecuteMenu() performs the menu options (described below) according to the user's choice and returns the pointer to the head node of the playlist.

Step 5: In main(), call PrintMenu() and prompt for the user's choice of menu options. (1 pt)

Each option is represented by a single character. If an invalid character is entered, continue to prompt for a valid choice. When a valid option is entered, execute the option by calling ExecuteMenu(). Then, print the menu, and prompt for a new option. Continue until the user enters 'q'. Hint: Implement Quit before implementing other options.

Ex:

    *JAMZ PLAYLIST MENU
    *a - Add song
    *d - Remove song
    *c - Change position of song
    *s - Output songs by specific artist
    *t - Output total time of playlist (in seconds)
    *o - Output full playlist
    *q - Quit
    *
    *Choose an option:

Step 6: Implement "Output full playlist" menu option in ExecuteMenu(). (3 pts)

If the list is empty, output: Playlist is empty

Ex:

    *JAMZ - OUTPUT FULL PLAYLIST
    *1.
    *Unique ID: SD123
    *Song Name: Peg
    *Artist Name: Steely Dan
    *Song Length (in seconds): 237
    *
    *2.
    *Unique ID: JJ234
    *Song Name: All For You
    *Artist Name: Janet Jackson
    *Song Length (in seconds): 391
    *
    *3.
    *Unique ID: J345
    *Song Name: Canned Heat
    *Artist Name: Jamiroquai
    *Song Length (in seconds): 330
    *
    *4.
    *Unique ID: JJ456
    *Song Name: Black Eagle
    *Artist Name: Janet Jackson
    *Song Length (in seconds): 197
    *
    *5. 
    *Unique ID: SD567
    *Song Name: I Got The News
    *Artist Name: Steely Dan
    *Song Length (in seconds): 306

Step 7: Implement the "Add song" menu option in ExecuteMenu(). (2 pts)

New additions are added to the end of the list.

Ex:

    *ADD SONG
    *Enter song's unique ID:
    *SD123
    *Enter song's name:
    *Peg
    *Enter artist's name:
    *Steely Dan
    *Enter song's length (in seconds):
    *237

Step 8: Implement the "Remove song" menu option in ExecuteMenu(). (4 pts)

Prompt the user for the unique ID of the song to be removed.

Ex:

    *REMOVE SONG
    *Enter song's unique ID:
    *JJ234
    *"All For You" removed.

Step 9: Implement the "Change position of song" menu option in ExecuteMenu().

Prompt the user for the current position of the song and the desired new position. Valid new positions are 1 - n (the number of nodes). If the user enters a new position that is less than 1, move the node to the position 1 (immediately after the head). If the user enters a new position greater than n, move the node to position n (the tail). 6 cases will be tested:

    - Moving the head node (1 pt)
    - Moving the tail node (1 pt)
    - Moving a node to the head (1 pt)
    - Moving a node to the tail (1 pt)
    - Moving a node up the list (1 pt)
    - Moving a node down the list (1 pt)

Ex:

    *CHANGE POSITION OF SONG
    *Enter song's current position:
    *3
    *Enter new position for song:
    *2
    *"Canned Heat" moved to position 2

Step 10: Implement the "Output songs by specific artist" menu option in ExecuteMenu(). (2 pt)

Prompt the user for the artist's name, and output the node's information, starting with the node's current position.

Ex:

    *OUTPUT SONGS BY SPECIFIC ARTIST
    *Enter artist's name:
    *Janet Jackson
    *
    *2.
    *Unique ID: JJ234
    *Song Name: All For You
    *Artist Name: Janet Jackson
    *Song Length (in seconds): 391
    *
    *4.
    *Unique ID: JJ456
    *Song Name: Black Eagle
    *Artist Name: Janet Jackson
    *Song Length (in seconds): 197

Step 11: Implement the "Output total time of playlist" menu option in ExecuteMenu(). (2 pts)

Output the sum of the time of the playlist's songs (in seconds).

Ex:

    *OUTPUT TOTAL TIME OF PLAYLIST (IN SECONDS)
    *Total time: 1461 seconds
